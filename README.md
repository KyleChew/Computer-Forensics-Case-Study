# Computer-Forensics-Case-Study

I was required to investigate the supplied forensic image using appropriate tools and 
forensic process and to develop and submit a written report on your findings. 
I can use any tools to undertake the investigation 

Please have a read of the background before going into my report , it will be much more interesting :D

Unfortunately i could not find my forensic image , i can only show the results that i have found and what i did to acheive this.
